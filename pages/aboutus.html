                <blockquote><p> Consumerism has become the norm in the West. It is a world in which we live to shop,
                   fuelled by an ever-increasing number of shopping malls and mega centres, and now the internet.
                    It is further facilitated by the endless media advertising campaigns tempting us with
                    all manner of goods, catering our every need. It is also a world of the disposable,
                    from paper cups to plastic bags and bottles, to computers and cars, all created on the
                    premise of speed, convenience and obsolescence. If and object no longer works or has
                    ceased to be attractive, it can easily be replaced with a newer version. In a world of
                    the new then, with such a vast array of consumer choice, why is consumption of all things
                     second-hand so popular today? What is it about the material culture of the second hand that
                     makes it so enduring? What are the reasons for this?</p>
                     <p class='authorship'> – Changing Patterns of Consumerism: The Rise and Rise of the Second Hand
                  – Deborah Jan Noon, Massey University (Wellington, New Zealand) </p></blockquote>
                <br>
                <p> &emsp; We are a community of people who believe our consumption habits could be key to build a more
                  sustainable world. We want to contribute to the change our generation can make in the global economy,
                  by reusing in addition to recycling and being conscious about the environmental impact our consuming
                  habits. Giving a second opportunity to good quality products, including electronics, clothes, toys,
                  books, furniture, and even bicycles and cars, will save you some money and help you to make of this
                  world a better place. </p>
                <p> &emsp; If all these is sounding a bit of too hippy for you, we want you to know that this is not all about
                 peace and love. It is also about being practical. We want to put you in contact with other people that
                 are near you that are looking for what you’re selling. We are thinking about that sweater your Auntie
                 Doris got you last Christmas or all that stuff you even didn’t know it was there until you moved into
                 your new apartment. Remember, moving three times is as bad as a fire. So, instead of burning down all
                 those things or throw them away, maybe you can make a little profit, while somebody saves some money and
                 you both contribute to a more sustainable economy. Everybody wins :-) </p>
                <p> &emsp; Second-hand markets are not moth-eaten place anymore. We have changed that social stigma, and now these
                 places are those where you find the last street-fashion trends or that previous book you cannot afford to
                 buy brand-new. Do you remember that phone that was in the market three years ago and could resist a fall from
                 the Moon? Why, instead of spending hours queueing for a Black Friday bargain, you spend that time cosy at home,
                 browsing our website to see if there is something that could fit your needs without draining your wallet? </p>
                <p> &emsp; We encourage you to use <a href='sell.html'> our website </a>to post all those things you don’t need any more or
                <a href='buy.html'>browse in our product list</a>
                to look for something that could fit your needs and can be collected near you. Your suggestions and comments

                  even related to an 'ewww' factor, it’s more that people think
                  this stuff is already designed to break, so why bother with
                  secondhand? Like anything else, there are more durable brands
                  available from secondhand charities. Being an informed

                them to value their clothes for longer. Looking to already
